  "0:05:00 - 0:10:00": "shipping on a dell pharaoh is a mathematics professor at the university of bologna sometime around fifteen ten he finds a method to reliably solve depressed cubic's these are a subset of cubic equations with no x squared term so what does he do after solving a problem that has stumped mathematicians for millennia when considered impossible by leonardo da vinci's math teacher he tells no one seat being a mathematician and the fifteen hundreds is hard your job is constantly under threat from other mathematicians who can show up at any time and challenge you for your position you can think of it like a math dual each participant submit a set of questions to the other and the person who solves the most questions correctly gets the job while the loser suffers public humiliation as far as del pharaoh knows no one else in the world can solve the depressed cubic so by keeping his solution secret he guarantees his own job security for nearly two decades del pharaoh keeps his secret only on his deathbed and fifteen twenty six does he let it slip to his student antonio few sure fewer it is not as talented a mathematician as his mentor but he is young and ambitious and after the pharaohs death he boasts about his own mathematical prowess and specifically his ability to solve the depressed cubic on february twelve fifteen thirty five for your challenges mathematician nicolo fontana tartaglia who has recently moved to for yours hometown of venice nicola fontana is no stranger to adversity as a kid his face was cut open by a french soldier leaving him with a stutter that's why he's known as tartaglia which means stirrer in italian growing up in poverty tartaglia is largely self taught he clause is way up through italian society to become a respected mathematician now all of that is at stake as is the custom in the challenge tartaglia gives a varied assortment of thirty problems to for your the or gives thirty problems to tartaglia all of which are depressed cubic's each mathematician has forty days to solve the thirty problems they've been given for your can't solve a single problem tartaglia solves all thirty of yours depressed cubic's in just two hours it seems furious boastful this was his undoing before the challenge came tartaglia learns if yours claim to have solved the depressed cubic but he's skeptical i did not deem him capable of finding such a rule on his own tartaglia rights but word was that a great mathematician had revealed the secrets to for your which seems more plausible so with the knowledge that a solution to the cubic is possible and with his livelihood on the line tartaglia sets about solving the depressed cubic himself to do it he extends the idea of completing the square into three them options take the equation x cubed plus nine x equals twenty six you can think of execute as the volume of a cube with sides of length x and if you add a volume of nine x you get twenty six so just like with complete in the square we need to add onto the cube to increase it's volume by nine x imagine extending three sides of this cube out a distance why creating a new larger cube with sides of length call it z z is just x plus why the original cube has been padded it out and we can break up the additional volume into seven shapes there are three rectangular prisms with dimensions of x by x by why and another three narrower prisms with dimensions of acts by why by why plus there's a cube with the volume why cubed tartaglia rearranges the six rectangular prisms into one block one side has length three why the other has a lie ink x plus why which is the and the height his ex so the volume of this shape is it's base three y z times it's height x and tartaglia realizes this volume can perfectly represent the nine x term in the equation if it's base is equal to nine so he sets three y z equals nine putting the queue back together you find were missing the one small why cubed block so we can complete the cube by adding why cubed to both sides of the equation now we have z cubed the complete larger que equals twenty six plus why cubed we have to equations and to unknowns solving the first decoration for easy and substituting into the second we get why to the six plus twenty six why cube equals twenty seven at first glance it seems like bird now worse off than when we started the variable is now raised to the power of six instead of just three however ",
  "0:10:00 - 0:15:00": "if you think of why cubed as a new variable the equation is actually quadratic the same quadratic that we solved by completing the square so we know why cubed equals one which means y equals one and z equals three over why so zero three and since exploits why equal z x must be equal to two which is indeed a solution to the original equation and with that tartaglia becomes the second human on the planet to solve the depressed cubic to save himself the work of going through the geometry for each new cubic he encounters to talia summarizes his method in an algorithm a set of instructions he writes this down not as a set of equations like we would today modern algebraic note nation wouldn't exist for another hundred years but instead as a poem to retaliate victory makes him something of a celebrity mathematicians are desperate to learn how he solved the cubic especially your lama card dunno a polymath based in milan as you can guess cartel yeah will have none of it he refuses to reveal even a single question from the competition but car dunno his paw persistent he writes a series of letters that alternate between flattery and aggressive attacks eventually with the promise of an introduction to his wealthy benefactor card dunno manages to lure talia to milan and they're on march twenty fifth fifteen thirty nine tartaglia reveals his method but only after forcing car dunno to swear a solemn oath not to tell anyone the method not to publish it and to write it only in cipher quote so that after my death no one shall be able to understand it kardono is delighted and immediately starts playing around with thirteen years algorithm but he has a lofty goal in mind a solution to the full cubic equation including the ec squared term and amazingly he discovers it if you substitute for x x minus be over three a then all the x where'd terms cancel out this is the way to turn any general cubic equation into a depressed cubic which can then be solved by tartaglia is formula kardono is so excited to have solved the problem that stumped the best mathematicians for thousands of years he wants to publish it unlike his peers cardinal has no need to keep the solution a secret he makes his living not as a mathematician but as a physician and famous intellectual for him the credit is more valuable than the secret the only problem is the oath he swore to tartaglia who won't let him break it and you might think this would be the end of it but and fifteen forty two kardono travels to bologna and there he visits a mathematician who just happens to be the son in law of one shipping on a dell pharaoh the man who on his deathbed gave the solution to the depressed cubic to antonio for your kardono finds this solution in pharaohs old notebook which is shared with him during the visit this solution predates tartaglia as by decades so now as kardono season he can publish the full solution to the cubic without violating his oath to tartaglia three years later kardono publishes ours magna the great art and updated compendium of mathematics written in five years may at last for five hundred cardona rights a chapter with a unique geometric proof for each of the thirteen arrangements of the cubic equation although he acknowledges the contributions of tartaglia del pharaoh and for your tartaglia is displeased to say the least he writes insulting letters to cuddle and cc is a good fraction of the mathematics community and he has a point to this day the general solution to the cubic is often called cardinals method but ours magna is a phenomenal achievement it pushes geometrical reasoning to it's very breaking point literally wild card dunno his writing ours magnet he comes across some cubic equations that can't easily be solved in the usual way like x cubed equals fifty next plus for plugging this into the algorithm yields a solution that contains the square roots of negative numbers dunno asks tartaglia about the case but he evades and implies kardono is just not clever enough to use his formula properly the reality his tartaglia has no idea what to do either cardona walks back through the geometric derivation of a similar problem to see exactly what goes wrong while the three cube slicing and rearrangement works just fine the final quadratic completing the square step leads to a geometric paradox cardinal fines part of a square that must have an area of thirty but also sides of length five since the full square has an area of twenty five two complete the square cardinal have to somehow add ",
