    "summary_title": "Mathematicians spent millennia trying to solve the cubic equation, limited by their insistence on real-world interpretations of numbers and geometry. Progress came only when they embraced abstract concepts like negative and imaginary numbers—initially considered nonsensical. This shift led to the invention of complex numbers, allowing for a general solution to the cubic and laying the groundwork for modern algebra. Centuries later, these imaginary numbers emerged at the heart of quantum mechanics, showing that letting go of reality was essential to understanding it more deeply.",
